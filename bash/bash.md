# Bash folder

#### This folder contains a script that was created long time ago as a part of bash practice.
#### It basically takes the output of the HTTP logs and outputs details like: 
- user with the most number of requests
- page with the most requests
- each client IP and the requests from it;
- pages returning 404 status;
- requests of the users marked as bots.
#### Usage: /bin/bash ./http_error_parser.sh log_file.log
